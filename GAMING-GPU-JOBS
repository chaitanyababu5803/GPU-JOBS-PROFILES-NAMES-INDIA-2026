GPU Performance Engineer: Focuses on optimizing hardware for specific workloads like mobile gaming or AI. FOR GAMES TOOLS/SKILLS REQUIRED
A GPU Performance Engineer focused on gaming bridges the gap between hardware architecture and real-world game execution. In this role, you ensure that the newest game engines and rendering techniques run efficiently on the hardware by identifying and eliminating bottlenecks in the graphics pipeline. 
Core Skills Required
Low-Level Programming: Mastery of C++ and C is essential for high-performance software and driver development. Proficiency in scripting languages like Python is critical for automating performance data analysis and benchmarking suites.
Graphics APIs & Shaders: Deep knowledge of modern APIs like DirectX 12, Vulkan, and Metal. You must be able to write and optimize shaders using HLSL or GLSL.
GPU Architecture Knowledge: A fundamental understanding of GPU microarchitecture, including memory hierarchies (caches, VRAM), execution units (shaders, ROPs), and warp/wavefront scheduling.
Performance Engineering: Expertise in identifying bottlenecks across compute, memory, and interconnects. Knowledge of parallel programming models like CUDA (NVIDIA) or ROCm (AMD) is often required, even for gaming-focused roles. 
Essential Tools
Profiling & Debugging:
NVIDIA Nsight Systems/Graphics: Used for deep-dive performance analysis on NVIDIA hardware.
PIX on Windows: Microsoft's primary tool for tuning and debugging DirectX 12 games.
RenderDoc: A popular open-source frame debugger for analyzing individual frames of a game.
Radeon GPU Profiler (RGP): AMD’s tool for visualizing GPU workloads and finding hardware-level bottlenecks.
Benchmarking & Analysis:
3DMark: Standard industry benchmark for assessing GPU stability and graphics handling.
Performance Counters: Using hardware-specific monitors to track real-time utilization metrics like occupancy and memory bandwidth.
Game Engines: Proficiency in Unreal Engine or Unity is often required to understand how proprietary engine tools interact with GPU drivers.
